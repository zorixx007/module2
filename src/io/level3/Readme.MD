o Create a scripting calculator using the text file.

o File contains next format of data:
 one plus three-two multiply one-one (meaning this expression 1 + 32 x 11)

 eight-one divide-by curly-brace-open three multiply four minus three curly-
brace-close (meaning this expression 81/(3 x 4-3))

o Result of each operation should be appended to the end of the string. Sample result:
 one plus three-two multiply one-one = three-five-three

 eight-one divide-by curly-brace-open three multiply four minus three curly-brace-close = nine

o Note: if number consists for several digits, it is written using hyphen (ie, three-two).
Curly braces are marked as curly-brace-open/curly-brace-close
