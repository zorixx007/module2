o Model a Zoo with 5 Animal Species classes and 1 shipping container class

o Using Generics implement the container so that it can contain any animal inside (donâ€™t
use Animal interface/abstract class). Each container should have a name (property) that
will show what exact animal specie is inside.

o Create a method that will place an Animal of any species inside a particular container
(both Animal and Container are arguments)

o Create a method that can place multiple Animals inside one container if they are of the
same family (carnivore/herbivore). One container cannot contain animals of different
families (otherwise, only one family will reach the destination :) )
