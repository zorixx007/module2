 Collections:
o Create a collection with Deposit objects to save the following data. All the objects must
be initialized and populated in init() method:

o Create a method getPrincipal() for get general sum of these deposits
o Iterate over the collection using 3 types of iterations

 Collections API:
o Sort a list of deposits from table above by interest value, then print sum and interest
value of all deposits from the list.
o Modify the code for the previous task in order to sort deposit list by principal sum using
Comparator interface.
o Apply three different styles of Comparators: inner class, anonymous class, lambda

 Iterator:
o Create remove() method that removes deposits from the list if deposit’s sum < 10000.0
